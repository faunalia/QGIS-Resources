# Dimensions style for QGIS

This style will add dimensions to all features of a polygon or polyline layer in QGIS.

**IMPORTANT!** due to a [bug in QGIS 3.0 and 3.1](https://issues.qgis.org/issues/18384) the original styles (line_dimensions.qml & polygon_dimensions.qml) won't show the dimensions in these versions of QGIS.  It does work in QGIS 2.18. An updated test version for polygons is made that does work in QGIS 3.0 (polygon_dimensions_3.qml).
